The key features we are chosing to work on are as follows:

F1: Generating the groups is the premise behind the entire program. Therefore at minimum this is needed. 

F3: Getting instructors and students preferences is very important for the the program as without that information, you would not be able to generate the groups

F11: Being able to have a valid balanced method for distributing students is also a key feature. This is because random is not a fair method of distribution.
